 Adidas Sales Analysis 

 Introduction
Adidas is one of the world’s largest sportswear manufacturers, known for its innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories. The company maintains a global presence and operates through various channels, including physical retail, e-commerce, and third-party retailers.

In this analysis, I focused on Adidas’ sales data, filtered by region and time-periods, to provide insights into overall performance and key metrics that impact business decisions. This project's goal was to better understand Adidas’ sales performance across the U.S. market, and how Adidas can optimize their sales strategies and identify potential areas for growth or improvement.

The analysis covers multiple dimensions, including total sales, operating profit, units sold, sales by month, and product categories. Additionally, performance by retailers and geographical regions is assessed to determine the best and worst performing areas. The ultimate goal was to uncover insights on sales trends, top performing products and retailers, and to make recommendations for driving profit growth.

 Problem Statement
Adidas wanted to gain a comprehensive understanding of Adidas' sales performance across different U.S. regions, with particular interest in identifying:
 The regions with the highest and lowest sales.
 Which products and stores were driving performance.
 The best months for sales and those that showed a decline.
 Sales trends across different periods.
 The best and worst performing stores and products in each region.
 Recommendations for maximizing profits and improving sales strategies.
